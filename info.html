        <h2>About This Visualization</h2>
        This was produced as a final project for Professor Michelle Borkin's Spring 2019 course CS 7250 by Sara Di Bartolomeo, Eysa Lee, Amogh Pradeep, and Laura South (ordered alphabetically).
        <br><br>
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        Although Spotify is one of the most popular music streaming services, the app does not currently provide users with a way to view their personal listening history. Several third-party apps allow users to see their personal listening data, but none fully utilize the power of data visualizations to convey information. Most simply provide a static list of the user's top tracks with no interactivity or exploratory capabilities. In this work we create an interactive data visualization using information available from the Spotify API to help users better understand their personal listening patterns. 
        <br><br>
        <h3>Data</h3>
        All data used in this project is acquired using the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/">Spotify Web API</a>.
        Each user first logs in to the Spotify platform and provides our webapp with authorization to fetch their public playlists, top tracks, top artists, and recently played list.
        Each list contains information regarding the artists/tracks depending on which request is performed.
        Using this information, we built our visualzation.
        All data is fetched from Spotify and processed by our browser app, thus, our website itself never handles any user data.
        We believe that this feature helps keep user data private and is an added benifit to using our visualization.
        <br>
        All data is fetched using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest">XML HTTP Requests</a>; the data itself is in JSON format.
        We fetch data entry in batches of 50 elements, as this is the limit the Spotify API specifies.

        <h3>Task Analysis</h3> <!-- Summary of interview and task table -->
        
        In order to determine tasks to prioritize in our design, we interviewed potential users of our visualization. Nine short interviews with people of varying listening habits were conducted to prevent overfitting to a single person's preferences. The interviews consisted of asking about listening habits, previous interactions with personalized music history visualizations (if at all), data they're interested in visualizing, and data they're not interested in being visualized. While all of the responses were unique and many of the users interviewed had vastly different ideas of what they would want out of a music history visualization, our main takeaway was that users were split on wanting this tool to be focused an individual user or to be used primarily to compare groups of friends. We ended up prioritizing solo use, as comparision can be done in an ad hoc manner with individualized results more easily than the other way around. Our high priority domain goals became viewing daily listening history split by genre and viewing top tracks and top artists, and comparing results with others became an optional goal.

        <h3>Design Process</h3> <!-- sketches and design choices to justify final visualization -->

        Our design process began with considering the goals from our task analysis and technical limitations from the exploratory analysis. We sketched mockups of a preliminary design, which consisted of a stream graph plotting frequently listened to genres in the short, medium, and long term and six columns listing top tracks and top artists for the same three time periods. In the original design, the columns for the top tracks and top artists were below the stream graph. When we implemented this design, we found that having the columns below the graph pushed the bottom of the list past the end of the page, which prevented users from seeing both the stream graph and the entire lists. We also conducted usability testing with students in our class, which identified areas for improvement. A few interactions in our visualization involved highlighting related data across columns by bolding relevant text, and we found that the bolding was being lost in the general brightness of the text. From this, one of the modifications we made was to dim irrelevant text to enhance the highlighting across columns.

        <h3>Final Visualization</h3>
Our final visualization has two primary components: a stream graph showing changes in what genres the user has listened to throughout their listening history and lists summarizing the user's top tracks and artists over three time periods. The three time periods we include are "Short Term" (the past few weeks), "Medium Term" (the past few months), and "Long Term" (the past few years). These time periods are defined and generated by the Spotify API. There are several forms of interaction connecting the two visualizations. The user can hover over a track to see more details about the song, including several scores calculated by Spotify about the character of a track, including "danceability" and "acousticness". Hovering over a song on the top tracks list will highlight the track's genre on the stream graph and will highlight the track's artist if they appear on any of the top artist lists. This provides an easy way for the user to see patterns and trends within their personal data that would not be visible without interactivity. Similarly, hovering over an artist on the top artists list will highlight their genre(s) on the stream graph and will highlight any of their tracks that appear on any of the top track lists. An overall "popularity" score will also appear underneath the artist's name. This is calculated by Spotify and represents the general current popularity of an artist across all Spotify listeners and provides an interesting way for the user to get a sense of how closely their personal listening habits align with broader trends across the Spotify platform. We also utilize brushing and linking to further connect our visualizations. The user can click on one or many genres in the stream graph to highlight every track and artist matching the current selection in the top artist and top track lists. Similarly, the user can click on tracks or artists to highlight their accompanying genres in the stream graph. We use a categorical color map to represent genres because musical genres are a categorical data attribute, with a maximum of ten genres to avoid perception issues associated with too many colors in a visualization.

        <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
        Data analysis is a personal process using our platform.
        Our tool is essentially an exploration tool that permits users to analyze their personal music-listening patterns.
        An example is that, on using the visualization tool, one of the authors found that their top artist has consistently stayed <a href="https://www.zhumusic.com/">ZHU</a> across all time periods we visualize.
        Thus, each person would have their own set of finding on using this tool.
        We urge the reader to use our tool to figure out your own music-listening patterns and hpe you enjoy it!

        <h3>Conclusion</h3> <!-- Short summary of work completed and areas for improvement/future-work -->
        In this work we use data gathered through the Spotify API to construct an overview of a user's current topic artists and top tracks and a stream graph of the genres a user has most frequently listened to in the short, medium, and long term. 
        Future works for this project include adding native support for comparision of music listening habits between users, which was an optional domain goal identified in our task analysis. Other potential improvements include adding a landing page for the visualization, introducing a walkthrough to introduce new users to the tool, and more complex computations over the data.
