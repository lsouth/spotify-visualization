%% Please use one of the ``review'' options in combination with the

%% Please note that the use of figures other than the optional teaser is not permitted on the first page

%% first page will be refused. Also, the teaser figure should only have the
%% width of the abstract as the template enforces it.

\eysa{This is the template for the paper and required sections (as specified in the milestone document). Text and other sections will be added.\\
Our motivation is roughly that we were curious about our own listening history and knew the data was there}.

\section{Related Works}
\eysa{Related works include Spotify's yearly end of year review and the LastFM document we found early on}
\subsection{Spotify Year in Review}

Introduce SpotifyWrapped (and/or year in review). It gives aggregate data (total minutes listened, top songs, top artists, top genre).\cite{Spo18} \eysa{A small note is that the card this is referenced is no longer available.}

\subsection{Last.fm}

\eysa{Introduce Last.fm, which lets users explore their lisetning data by either connecting with their streaming service or uploading. There has much work in using this data}

Pretzlav created Last.fm Explorer \cite{Pre08} \eysa{either add screenshots or describe in words. It also has a stacked bar chart}.

Later, Dang, Anand, and Wilkinson created FmFinder \cite{Dan12} \eysa{Describe this one, too}

More recently Boeing explore their own listening history from Last.fm and wrote up a blog post \cite{Boe16}. \eysa{Make this sound nicer}

\section{Process}
\subsection{Task Analysis}
We conducted nine short interviews with potential users of our visualization \eysa{todo: add summary of the results of the interviews. Can add a table if I reaaaaally want to...}

From our interviews, we determined our domain goals to be the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item View daily listening history split by genre
  \item View recent top artists/tracks
  \item Compare listening history between users
\end{enumerate}

\eysa{todo: add discussion about these domain goals}

\begin{figure*}
\centering
\mbox{
  \subfigure[Genre interaction.\label{fig:genre_interaction}]{\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{genre_interaction}}\quad
  \subfigure[Artist interaction.\label{fig:artist_interaction}]{\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{artist_interaction}}\quad
  \subfigure[Track interaction.\label{fig:track_interaction}]{\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{track_interaction}}
}
\caption{Primary interactions: Hovering over different areas in the visualization highlights and connects data between the stacked area chart and the two lists.\eysa{come back and make this nicer to read}}
\label{fig:interactions}
\end{figure*}

\section{Design}

Interactions can be found in \autoref{fig:interactions}.

This section will address:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item How do we address our domain goals from before.
  \item Usability testing. Was there anything we changed based on classmates testing our preliminary design
\end{enumerate}

\section{Discussion}
This section will include discussion on:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item What was the response like?
  \item What were areas we wanted to explore but couldn't
  \item What could we improve?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}

Future directions include:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Computing over the data
  \item How can we make it easier for people to compare?
\end{enumerate}

%% if specified like this the section will be committed in review mode
