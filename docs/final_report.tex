\maketitle

Spotify is one of the most popular music streaming service, with 207 million monthly active users in 2018. The app does not currently provide users with a way to view their personal listening history despite the popularity of its annual end of year visualization, which provides users a high-level overview of a their listening habits for the year. Several third-party apps allow users to see their personal listening data, but none fully utilize the power of data visualizations to convey information. In this work we create an interactive data visualization using information available from the Spotify API to help users better understand their personal listening patterns.

\section{Related Works}
Many applications exist to visualization a user's Spotify listening history, with usages and data being displayed varying. We will consider the related works as two broad categories: (1) Spotify's official end of year visualization and (2) third-party applications.

\subsection{Spotify's End of Year Visualization}

While generally Spotify does not provide user's with a way to visualize their personal listening history, at the end of each year Spotify releases a visualization `summarizing' a user's listening history for the past year\cite{Spo18}.

This visual summary has gone by different names over the years, such as \emph{SpotifyWrapped} and \emph{Year in Review}, but the purpose of the visualization has remained fairly consistent. It focuses on giving users an overview of their year by displaying aggregated data, such as total minutes listened, top tracks, top artists, and top genre. Additionally, it only displays data from a fixed range of time (January to October) and only displays a fixed number of tracks and artists. While this accomplishes the purpose of giving a year summary for a user, it does not provide users much freedom in exploring their data. This visualization has the additional drawback of only being available for a limited amount of time each year.

\subsection{Third-party Applications}

Many third-party services exist to utilize the data available from using a music streaming service. One of the more popular services is Last.fm, which gives users an interface to explore their data upon connecting to their streaming service. This has spawned applications such as \cite{Pre08,Dan12}, which use Last.fm's API to allow users to explore their personal data.
These services, however, either require a lot of upfront effort from the user to use their service (such as registering an account)\eysa{what's a better way to phrase this?} or provide \emph{too much} data and can be difficult for a user to process.

Another popular class of third-party applications are simply scripts written by curious programmers, such as \cite{Boe16}. It is hardly surprising that many casual programmers, noticing the abundance of data and lack of existing popular visualization, whip up scripts visualizing their personal data and make the code available for others. This class of applications suffers from similar drawbacks to services using Last.fm. These mostly lack web interfaces, which results in work for a user to download and figure out how to run scripts. Additionally, these applications mostly try to visualize as much as possible, which can be an overwhelming amount of data for a user.

\section{Design Process}

\subsection{Task Analysis}

\input{tab_interviews}

In order to determine tasks to prioritize in our design, we interviewed potential users of our visualization. Nine short interviews with people of varying listening habits were conducted to prevent overfitting to a single person's preferences. The interviews consisted of asking about (1) listening habits, (2) previous interactions with personalized music history visualizations, if at all, (3) data they're interested in visualizing, and (4) data they're not interested in being visualized. Summaries of responses are reported in \autoref{tab:interviews}.

From our interviews, we determined our domain goals to be the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item View daily listening history split by genre
  \item View recent top artists/tracks
  \item Compare listening history between users
\end{enumerate}

\eysa{todo: add discussion about these domain goals}

\subsection{Data Acquisition and Exploratory Analysis}
Data Acquisition and Exploratory Analysis Outline:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Tested fetching data using Spotify API, generally didn't find bad data
  \item Discovered getting breakdown of music by day or hour requires retrieving many batches of last played and looking at timestamps; limitations on the granularity our visualization can display
\end{itemize}

\section{Design}

\subsection{Mockup}
\input{fig_mockup}

Design outline:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Captured our domain goals in the final sketch of what we wanted\eysa{can add the final sketches}. Interactions with these sketches can be seen in \autoref{fig:interactions}
  \item Talk about how the sketch accomplishes our domain goals
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We prioritized the first two domain goals because user interviews indicated people cared more about personal data
  \end{itemize}
  \item Changes between sketch and implementation. Was there anything we changed based on classmates testing our preliminary design
  \item Implementation (screenshot and description)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Preliminary Usability Testing}
Outline:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain how we conducted our usability tests (Introduced our project and asked users to play around with the visualization; asked users if they could identify what particular things were supposed to represent)
  \item Pros: color scheme, nice to look at
  \item Cons: Hard to see when artists/tracks are bolded (doesn't stand out much); columns are not labled; no title to indicate if the visualization is a prediction or history of music listening; stream graph and lists don't fit on the screen together
  \item How to visualize genres in stream graph without overloading it?
\end{itemize}

\input{fig_prelim}

\subsection{Final Design}

Modifications based on usability testing:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Moved stream graph and track/artist columns horizontally; took advantage of most desktop screens being wider than taller and placed things on the side
  \item Added an "other" category for genre; not having an "other" category previously made for some stream graphs appearing to get smaller in mid ranges; compromise to not overload graph with too many colors but not lose the data
  \item Added titles to the track/artist columns
  \item Changed genre encodings on artist to circles; artists may have many genres associated with them, so this eliminates lines overflowing over other text
  \item Added fade/bolding across artist columns to better visualize relationships across columns
  \item Added description at the bottom to explain the visualization
  \item Added tooltip walkthrough to explain how the visualization works
\end{itemize}

Outline:
\begin{itemize}
  \item How did our final design change?
  \item Main aspects of the final design
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}

Discussion outline:
\begin{itemize}
  \item What was the response like?
  \item What were areas we wanted to explore but couldn't
  \item What could we improve?
  \item Usability testing:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Early usability testing suggested users had difficulty discovering all of the features of the visualization.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

Future directions include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Computing over the data
  \item How can we make it easier for people to compare?
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Maybe change genre color scheme to be the same for each genre rather than same colors for each user?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
