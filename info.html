        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Data</h3>
        All data used in this project is acquired using the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/">Spotify Web API</a>.
        Each user first logs in to the Spotify platform and provides our webapp with authorization to fetch their public playlists, top tracks, top artists, and recently played list.
        Each list contains information regarding the artists/tracks depending on which request is performed.
        Using this information, we built our visualzation.
        All data is fetched from Spotify and processed by our browser app, thus, our website itself never handles any user data.
        We believe that this feature helps keep user data private and is an added benifit to using our visualization.
        <br>
        All data is fetched using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest">XML HTTP Requests</a>; the data itself is in JSON format.
        We fetch data entry in batches of 50 elements, as this is the limit the Spotify API specifies.

        <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
        Data analysis is a personal process using our platform.
        Our tool is essentially an exploration tool that permits users to analyze their personal music-listening patterns.
        An example is that, on using the visualization tool, one of the authors found that their top artist has consistently stayed <a href="https://www.zhumusic.com/">ZHU</a> across all time periods we visualize.
        Thus, each person would have their own set of finding on using this tool.
        We urge the reader to use our tool to figure out your own music-listening patterns and hpe you enjoy it!
