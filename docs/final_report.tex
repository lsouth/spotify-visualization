%% Uncomment one of the lines above depending on where your paper is
%% in the conference process. ``review'' and ``widereview'' are for review
%% submission, ``preprint'' is for pre-publication, and the final version
%% doesn't use a specific qualifier.

%% Please use one of the ``review'' options in combination with the
%% assigned online id (see below) ONLY if your paper uses a double blind
%% review process. Some conferences, like IEEE Vis and InfoVis, have NOT
%% in the past.

%% Please note that the use of figures other than the optional teaser is not permitted on the first page
%% of the journal version.  Figures should begin on the second page and be
%% in CMYK or Grey scale format, otherwise, colour shifting may occur
%% during the printing process.  Papers submitted with figures other than the optional teaser on the
%% first page will be refused. Also, the teaser figure should only have the
%% width of the abstract as the template enforces it.

%% These few lines make a distinction between latex and pdflatex calls and they
%% bring in essential packages for graphics and font handling.
%% Note that due to the \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{} call it is no longer necessary
%% to provide the the path and extension of a graphics file:
%% \includegraphics{diamondrule} is completely sufficient.

\eysa{This is the template for the paper and required sections (as specified in the milestone document). Text and other sections will be added.\\
Our motivation is roughly that we were curious about our own listening history and knew the data was there}.

\section{Related Works}
\eysa{Related works include Spotify's yearly end of year review and the LastFM document we found early on}

\section{Process}
\subsection{Task Analysis}
We conducted nine short interviews with potential users of our visualization \eysa{todo: add table with summary of the results of the interview}

From our interviews, we determined our domain goals to be the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item View daily listening history split by genre
  \item View recent top artists/tracks
  \item Compare listening history between users
\end{enumerate}

\eysa{todo: add discussino about these domain goals}
