        <h2>About This Visualization</h2>
        This was produced as a final project for Michelle Borkin's Spring 2019 course CS 7250 by Sara Di Bartolomeo, Eysa Lee, Amogh Pradeep, and Laura South (ordered alphabetically).

        <h3>Task Analysis</h3> <!-- Summary of interview and task table -->
        
        In order to determine tasks to prioritize in our design, we interviewed potential users of our visualization. Nine short interviews with people of varying listening habits were conducted to prevent overfitting to a single person's preferences. The interviews consisted of asking about listening habits, previous interactions with personalized music history visualizations (if at all), data they're interested in visualizing, and data they're not interested in being visualized. While all of the responses were unique and many of the users interviewed had vastly different ideas of what they would want out of a music history visualization, our main takeaway was that users were split on wanting this tool to be focused an individual user or to be used primarily to compare groups of friends. We ended up prioritizing solo use, as comparision can be done in an ad hoc manner with individualized results more easily than the other way around. Our high priority domain goals became viewing daily listening history split by genre and viewing top tracks and top artists, and comparing results with others became an optional goal.

        <h3>Design Process</h3> <!-- sketches and design choices to justify final visualization -->

        Our design process began with considering the goals from our task analysis and technical limitations from the exploratory analysis to sketch mockups of a preliminary design. The preliminary design consisted of a stream graph plotting frequently listened to genres in the short, medium, and long term. Below the stream graph, we had six columns listing top tracks and top artists for the same three time periods.
